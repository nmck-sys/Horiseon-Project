# Horiseon Project

## Description

The web page was modified to meet accessibility standards so that Horiseon is optimized for search engines. All links were ensured to be working accurately. The layout was edited to ensure easier access to all elements. The project solves accesibility and ease of use issues. I learned how to edit classes in html, edit folder pathways, edit element positioning in css, add developer comments, and structure the html elements properly.
